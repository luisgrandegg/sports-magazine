I'm building a female sports magazine.
For the MVP, I want to create a app that shows a report for a match with the following features:
- Match chronicle
- Match stats by team
- Match stats by player
- Match MVP
- Heatmap visualization of shootings by team and player

I also want my users to be able to see the profile of teams and players with the following features:
- Aggregated stats and insights by team and player during the season
- Heatmap of shootings by player and team

For this, I want you to guide me on the creation of a Nextjs application. I will describe you later step by step how I want my app to be.
First, can you guide me on setting up a new Nextjs app with TypeScript?
I would also like to integrate prettier, lintstaged and husky.
I will be using conventional commits, can you add guide me on adding commitlint?
I will be using volta for managing system dependencies. Can you guide me on how to pin node and npm lts versions?
