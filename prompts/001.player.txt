Now, let's start getting into the code.

We will start with the Player.
I want you to create a PlayerService and a PlayerRepository class that we will use to get data from the players.
I want the PlayerService to have the following methods:
    get -> will get all players
    getOne --> will receive a player id and will return that player
    getHeatmap --> will receive a player id and will return the data to build a heatmap for that player
